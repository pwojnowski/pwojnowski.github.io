In this article we describe a number of common productivity
pitfalls. Eliminating even some of them will improve your efficiency. Good luck!

## Multitasking

It comes down to performing several tasks at once. The idea seems to be
great. You should be more productive doing two things simultaneously instead of
finishing one task and starting a new one. Ingenious? Not really.

Multitasking will only work in cases where both activities do not require
commitment or focus. A great example would be watching TV while doing the dishes
or ironing. In case of complex tasks or tasks that require a lot of
concentration you are not able to divide your attention evenly between both of
them. As a result, you will be doing one thing by turns for a short period of
time – you will be switching. In fact, you will not be able to devote the full
attention to any of those things, it’s just the way your brain works. Therefore
it may turn out that you have just lost time and none of the tasks is
completed.

## No ToDo list

Imagine that you suddenly have some free time and could start working on a new
task. Without a ToDo list you will begin to wonder what needs to be
done. Before you pick any task which seems important and might fill this time
gap, it appears that the time is over. Thanks to a structured ToDo list you can
tackle a new task whenever you have free time.

## No priorities

Even if you make a ToDo list but aren’t using priorities, such a list may prove
to be of no use. Let’s say you have a total of 70 tasks on your list. Even if
you manage to complete one, there will still be 69 remaining. This is quite a
lot and this number may be overwhelming. If you begin to use priorities, it will
be easier to create daily and weekly ToDo lists.

You can mark the tasks with colors, numbers or letters. It may be helpful to use
the following key:

1.  Top priority – tasks which should be done asap and it’s impossible to
    postpone them. Examples are : meeting an important client, paying the
    bills, writing a report, preparing offers etc.

2.  Tasks with an early deadline, but the lack of their execution is not
    associated with such consequences as the task from group 1 (meeting a less
    important client, replying to emails).

3.  Things that you enjoy or make you relax – meeting friends, buying new
    clothes or your favorite author’s new book.

4.  Tasks to delegate to a third party.

5.  Low priority tasks, try to minimize their number.

## Postponing tasks

Definitely your ToDo list consists of things that you don’t want to tackle for
a variety of reasons. If you put them off, usually you will not complete
them. If the problem is the task’s complexity, divide it into smaller tasks and
start with baby steps. If this is something you don’t like doing, delegate if
possible. Stick to the Do-It-Now (DIN) rule. If something takes less than 5
minutes to complete, do it right now. Remember the sooner you start, the sooner
you finish and will be able to tick off this unpleasant task from your list.

## Bad workplace organization

Some of us are chaotic and having a ToDo list is the only neat thing in their
lives. Start by cleaning up / organizing your desk. Mess means that you
unnecessarily waste precious time every day when you try to find documents or
any required utensils. Instead of wasting time this way, it’s much better to
spend it on executing tasks. Studies reveal that messy employees lose 7-8 hours
per week to search for necessary items. This is a full workday! Desk is
obviously a symbolic workplace, this could be your workshop, kitchen, etc. A
clean workplace is therefore the basis for success.

## Fatigue

Too little sleep is the enemy of productivity. When you are tired it’s hard to
focus on a particular thing and to complete it fast. Fatigue is also a perfect
excuse for another cup of coffee. Making coffee costs time that you could use
productively.

## Doing everything yourself

Probably you think you’re the only person that can do a certain task best. We
have to disappoint you. There are a lot of people as good as you. :-) We used to
think like that too and we know it is a mistake. You should delegate many tasks
to save time and money.

## Not managing distractions

We all know this: incoming call, message from your friends, a new Facebook
post. All of these factors can distract you from the task that you are busy
with. You lose concentration and start dealing with less important
things. Sounds familiar?

We’ll write about managing interruptions in one of the next posts.

## Lack of self-discipline

A part of our mindset is that we first try to do pleasant things and we postpone
the less pleasant ones. It often turns out that there is no time to tackle those
unpleasant chores. Therefore, as **Brian Tracy**, the author of **“Eat That Frog”**,
says, first do things that you do not like and that are likely to be
time-consuming. Leave the pleasant tasks for the end of the day.
